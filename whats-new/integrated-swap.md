# Integrated Swap

## Swap page

Users can now swap all tokens listed on Venus, plus almost 300 more through our new "Swap" page. We use [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) in order to make the exchange.

## Supplying tokens and repaying loans through a swap

Where users previously had to own a specific token they wished to supply, they can now do so by swapping any other tokens they own, all that through a single transaction and from a single interface: the supply modal.

Users can repay a loan using the same mechanism. In this case, by swapping one of their existing tokens for the exact amount of tokens they owe and repaying their loan with the latter, here as well within a single transaction and from a single interface: the borrow modal.
