# Submitting a VIP

### Overview

Venus Protocol's governance model allows token holders to propose and vote on Venus Improvement Proposals (VIPs). Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create and submit a proposal. Remember, you need a voting weight of at least 300,000 to submit a proposal.

### Step 1: Visit the Venus Governance Portal

Navigate to the Venus Governance Portal using your preferred web browser. You can access the portal at <https://app.venus.io/governance>.

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

To submit a proposal, you need to connect your digital wallet. Locate the "Connect Wallet" button at the top right corner of the screen and click on it. A dropdown menu will appear, listing various wallets that the Venus Governance Portal supports. Select your wallet from the dropdown menu and follow the instructions to connect your wallet to the portal.

### Step 3: Create a Proposal

Now that your wallet is connected, you can create a proposal. Look for the "Create Proposal" button at the top right corner of the screen and click on it.
