# Delegating & Voting

### Overview

Participation in the Venus Protocol governance process requires that users delegate their voting power. This process ensures that XVS tokens held in the vault are eligible to vote on Venus Improvement Proposals (VIPs). Notably, with the new governance model, this process needs to be done only once.

### Delegate Voting Power

**Step 1: Visit the Venus Governance Portal**

Access the Venus governance portal via your browser. The URL is [https://app.venus.io/governance](https://app.venus.io/governance).

**Step 2: Connect Your Wallet**

On the top right corner of the screen, click on the "Connect Wallet" button. Choose your wallet from the dropdown menu and follow the prompts to connect.

**Step 3: Delegate Your Voting Power**

Once your wallet is connected, click on the "Delegate" button in the Governance section. This will open up a new dialogue box.

A confirmation prompt will appear in your connected wallet (for example, MetaMask). Confirm the transaction to complete the voting power delegation process.

Congratulations, you've now enabled your XVS in the vault to participate in Venus Protocol's governance. Your tokens are now ready to vote on upcoming VIP proposals. Remember, your engagement in the protocolâ€™s decision-making process is vital for its future development and success.

### Vote for a VIP

#### Step 7: Select the VIP Proposal&#x20;

To vote on a Venus Improvement Proposal (VIP), navigate to the list of active proposals on the Venus Governance Portal. Click on the title of the VIP you wish to vote on. _**Remember, your voting eligibility requires your address to be delegated.**_
