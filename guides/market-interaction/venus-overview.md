# Venus Overview
Venus Protocol is a decentralized lending platform that lives on the BNB Chain. It works in a decentralized way, which means that it doesn't rely on a single authority to control it. The main purpose of Venus is to allow people to lend their cryptocurrency to others and to borrow cryptocurrency from others. This guide will show you how to lend your cryptocurrency and earn interest on it, as well as how to borrow cryptocurrency. Additionally, you can also learn how to "farm" special tokens called $XVS tokens, which can be earned as a reward on the platform.

## How does Venus work?

Venus Protocol allows you to deposit different types of cryptocurrencies and earn annual interest on your deposits, similar to how you earn interest in a traditional bank savings account. However, there is a key difference: Venus Protocol doesn't have control over your cryptocurrency. Instead, you interact with a smart contract, which means there is no central authority that can access your funds. This is one of the main distinctions between Venus, a DeFi protocol, and a traditional bank.

The Venus Markets are always available, so you can lend or borrow cryptocurrency quickly and without any approval process or restrictions. In DeFi, the interest rates are often higher than those offered by traditional banks because the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is boosted by farming the platform's native governance token, $XVS. This token is distributed to users who supply liquidity, borrow assets, or mint VAI stablecoins.

### What are Isolated Pools?
Apart from Venus core pool, Venus has introduced a new product called "isolated pools." These pools allow users to interact not only with the markets from the core pool but also with markets from other pools. This is primarily done for risk management purposes. By separating riskier tokens into isolated pools, the performance of the core pool is not affected if a risky token's value fluctuates significantly, as seen with LUNA. This risk management approach ensures that risks are managed for the entire pool rather than individual markets. Other than that, interaction with the markets within the pool (supplying/borrowing adn etc.) is the same, you just need to choose with which pool you would like to interact beforehand.

## How do I access Venus?
Venus Protocol uses audited smart contracts to facilitate all the lending and borrowing activities involving popular cryptocurrencies. Instead of following the traditional account creation and login process, users can access Venus Protocol through a web3 wallet. Some examples of web3 wallets include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and BNB Chain Wallet. These wallets enable users to securely interact with Venus Protocol and manage their lending and borrowing transactions.
