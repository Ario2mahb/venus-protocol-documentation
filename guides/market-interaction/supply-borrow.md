# Supply and Borrow
In this guide, we will focus on using Venus Protocol to earn interest and borrow BNB Chain assets. If you’re looking for a more technical understanding of what’s happening under the hood, check out Venus Protocol’s whitepaper.

Once you’ve created your BNB Chain Wallet on MetaMask or any other supported wallet App, open the Venus app ([app.venus.io](https://app.venus.io/)). The interface will ask you to connect your Web3 wallet. Connecting your wallet to Venus Protocol enables you to authorize transactions, view balances, and perform other essential actions on the BNB Chain.

After successfully connecting your wallet, you will gain access to all the features of the Venus Protocol interface. In the Dashboard menu you will find all the markets. Clicking one of the markets a new modal will pop out, enabling you to interact with the selected market. Just make sure you are under the "Supply" or "Borrow" tab, depending on the desired action.

##  Supply Assets to Earn Interest on Venus

Lets say you want to supply some TRX. You are already in the "Dashboard" menu, under the "Supply" tab and you click TRX market. First, you will need to enable the asset you wish to supply. This will ask you to confirm a transaction with your wallet, there will be a small gas fee, so you will need some BNB in your wallet to cover it.

Once your transaction is confirmed, you can proceed to specify the amount you want to supply. The assets you choose to supply will be transferred directly from your DeFi wallet to Venus Protocol, and they will immediately start earning interest. It's important to note that you won't see any incoming transactions for the interest earned because it will be automatically added to your Supply Balance. Over time, you will notice your balance gradually increasing.

It's worth emphasizing that you have complete control over your assets. At any point, you can withdraw any portion of your balance from Venus Protocol and transfer it back to your BNB Chain wallet. This ensures that you always have access to your funds and can manage them according to your needs and preferences.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
When you lend an asset on Venus Protocol, you receive vTokens in return. It's important to note that these vTokens represent the asset you deposited as collateral on Venus, so it's crucial not to trade or transfer them if you have an active loan.

vTokens serve as a tokenized representation of your supplied balance on Venus Protocol. Each vToken has its own unique BEP20 address, which you can verify on BNB Chain explorers like bscscan.

When you supply an asset to Venus, you receive an equivalent amount of vTokens in exchange. These vTokens allow you to accumulate interest over time based on the market's Supply Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Here's an example to illustrate how it works:

Let's assume the vTRX/TRX rate is 0.0204. If you supply 1000 TRX to Venus, you would receive approximately 49019 vTRX in return (1000 / 0.0204).

Now, suppose that after one year, the vTRX/TRX rate has increased to 0.0215. This means your 49019 vTRX would now be worth 1021.5 TRX (49019 * 0.0215) — an increase of 21.5 TRX.

Please note that the specific rates used in the example are for illustration purposes only and may not reflect the actual rates on Venus Protocol.
