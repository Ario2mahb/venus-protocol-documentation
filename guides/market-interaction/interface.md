# Venus interface

Let's take a quick look at the Venus interface and the features available in each menu of the navigation bar.

### Dashboard

In the center of the Dashboard interface, you will find the Supply and Borrow markets. You'll also notice a new column called 'Pool' which identifies the pool to which each market belongs. The Supply market allows you to lend your cryptocurrency assets and earn interest on them. You can choose which assets to supply and specify the amount you want to lend. On the other hand, the Borrow market allows you to borrow cryptocurrency assets by using your supplied assets as collateral. You can select the assets you want to borrow and specify the amount you need.
