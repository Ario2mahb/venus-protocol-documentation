#### Step 4: Enter the Amount to Bridge

#### Step 5: Approve XVS Token

#### Step 6: Initiate the Transfer

#### Step 8: Transaction Completion

* Once the transaction is complete, the XVS tokens will be available in your Ethereum wallet.

Bridging XVS tokens from BNB Chain to Ethereum is made simple with the Venus Protocol. Remember to approve your tokens for use by the bridge and to check transaction details carefully before confirming to ensure a smooth bridging experience.
