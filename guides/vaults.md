# Vaults

Vaults within Venus Protocol provide a secure and efficient mechanism for users to stake their tokens, whether XVS or VAI, and earn passive income. This staking process allows users to actively participate in and contribute to the stability and security of the Venus ecosystem, while maximizing returns on their holdings.&#x20;

**Staking in XVS Vault**

1. Navigate to the Venus app (app.venus.io) and connect your BNB Chain Wallet or other supported wallet apps.
2. On the left side of the screen, click on the 'Vault' tab.
3. A new screen will display two options: XVS and VAI vaults. Select the 'XVS' vault.
4. Once you select the XVS vault, a new interface will show. Click the 'Stake' button.
5. A pop-up will appear asking for the amount of XVS you want to stake. Input the desired amount and confirm.
6. After entering the amount, a prompt will ask for the transaction's confirmation in your wallet. Confirm this.
7. Once you've staked your XVS tokens, the interface will show the staked amount, your potential rewards, and other vault statistics.

**Staking in VAI Vault**

1. Follow the same steps as above to access the 'Vault' tab in the Venus app.
2. This time, select the 'VAI' vault.
3. Upon clicking on the 'VAI' vault, you'll see the option to 'Stake'.
4. Enter the amount of VAI you'd like to stake and confirm the staking action.
5. Just like with the XVS vault, you'll need to confirm the transaction in your wallet.
6. After staking, the interface will show the staked amount, potential rewards, and other relevant statistics related to the VAI vault.
