# Security & Audits

At Venus, our utmost dedication lies in ensuring the highest levels of security for our users. Throughout the entire Smart Contract development lifecycle, we strictly adhere to industry best practices to uphold the integrity of our platform. To further fortify our security measures, we collaborate with renowned auditing firms in the field. These partnerships enable us to conduct comprehensive security assessments of our protocol, thereby safeguarding our users' funds effectively.

The security of the Venus protocol stands as our highest priority. Our development team, in conjunction with third-party auditors and consultants, has invested substantial efforts to create a protocol that we confidently deem safe and dependable. We prioritize transparency by making all contract code and balances publicly verifiable. Moreover, we offer a bug bounty program to security researchers who report undiscovered vulnerabilities, encouraging continuous improvement and vigilance.

We firmly believe that the true test of a smart contract's security lies in its size, visibility, and time. Consequently, we urge users to exercise caution and make independent assessments of the security and suitability of our protocol.
