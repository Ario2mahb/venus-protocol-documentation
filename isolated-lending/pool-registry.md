# Pool Registry

## Introduction
The pool registry maintains the isolated lending pools in the directory and can perform actions like creating and registering new isolated lending pools to the directory, adding new markets to existing pools, setting and updating the poolâ€™s required metadata, and providing the getters methods to get an inside view of the pools.

## Details

Isolated lending has three main components: PoolRegistry, Pools, and Markets. The PoolRegistry is responsible for managing pools. It can create new pools, update pool metadata and manage markets within pools. Pool Registry has some getter methods to get the details of any existing pool like getVTokenForAsset, getPoolsSupportedByAsset, updatePoolMetadata etc.

Pool Registry provides a pool Id to each pool mapped with the pool's comptroller address. Each comptroller mapped with the pool's metadata details which contain the additional information of that pool. Pool Registry also supports some other functionality like, users can bookmark the selected pools through the bookmarkPool method and can get the list of the all bookmarked pools through the getBookmarks method, Pool Registry also maps the asset to the supported list so it will be easier to get all the pools which support the similar asset through getPoolsSupportedByAsset method.


Venus provides the risk rating for each isolated pool. Through this rating users can select the appropriate pool to allocate their assets.

### Pools

Venus introduces Isolated pools. It gives the ability to create an independent market with specific assets and custom risk management configurations. Pool Registry helps to create a new Isolated pool in the directory through createRegistryPool method. It will take the required fields as parameters like deployed comptroller address, price oracle address, and etc, then create a proxy for the comptroller and set the msg.sender as the admin of the comptroller, provide an ID to the pool and update all the other states of the Pool Registry to add the pool to the directory.
 

### Markets

To add a new market to a lending pool, the PoolRegistry deploys the JumpRate or WhitePaperInterestRate factory as an interest rate model to calculate the interest for the borrowers and lenders according to the available liquidity of the protocol. Then deploys the upgradable vToken for the market to handle all the transactions within the market, in the last comptroller(pool) supports the market, and all the internal states of the Pool Registry get updated.
