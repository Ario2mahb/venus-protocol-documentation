# Comptroller
The Comptroller is designed to provide checks for all minting, redeeming, transferring, borrowing, lending, repaying, liquidating,
and seizing done by the `vToken` contract. Each pool has one `Comptroller` checking these interactions across markets. When a user interacts
with a given market by one of these main actions, a call is made to a corresponding hook in the associated `Comptroller`, which either allows
or reverts the transaction. These hooks also update supply and borrow rewards as they are called. The comptroller holds the logic for assessing
liquidity snapshots of an account via the collateral factor and liquidation threshold. This check determines the collateral needed for a borrow,
as well as how much of a borrow may be liquidated. A user may borrow a portion of their collateral with the maximum amount determined by the
markets collateral factor. However, if their borrowed amount exceeds an amount calculated using the market‚Äôs corresponding liquidation threshold,
the borrow is eligible for liquidation.

The `Comptroller` also includes two functions `liquidateAccount()` and `healAccount()`, which are meant to handle accounts that do not exceed
the `minLiquidatableCollateral` for the `Comptroller`:

- `healAccount()`: This function is called to seize all of a given user‚Äôs collateral, requiring the `msg.sender` repay a certain percentage
of the debt calculated by `collateral/(borrows*liquidationIncentive)`. The function can only be called if the calculated percentage does not exceed
100%, because otherwise no `badDebt` would be created and `liquidateAccount()` should be used instead. The difference in the actual amount of debt
and debt paid off is recorded as `badDebt` for each market, which can then be auctioned off for the risk reserves of the associated pool.
- `liquidateAccount()`: This function can only be called if the collateral seized will cover all borrows of an account, as well as the liquidation
incentive. Otherwise, the pool will incur bad debt, in which case the function `healAccount()` should be used instead. This function skips the logic
verifying that the repay amount does not exceed the close factor.
