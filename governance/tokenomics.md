### Overview

Venus Protocol's revenue distribution model addresses different revenue streams, applying distinct allocation schemes to protocol reserves and other sources of income such as liquidation penalties and new product revenues.

### Revenue Distribution from Protocol Reserves

Protocol reserves primarily consist of accumulated borrow fees subjected to reserve factors. The revenue allocation model for these reserves divides income into four main categories:

1. **Risk Fund (40%):** This fund is established to address potential shortfalls in the protocol, particularly in situations of ineffective or delayed liquidations. The allocation to the risk fund also serves as a financial buffer, potentially facilitating the protocol's current shortfall via a financing (bond) mechanism.
2. **XVS Vault Rewards (20%):** The Venus protocol incentivizes users through XVS Vault Rewards, maintaining a stable allocation of 20% of the reserve revenue.
3. **DAO Operations and Funding (20%):** To ensure smooth operations and continuous development, 20% of the reserve revenue is assigned to Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) operations and funding.
4. **Venus Prime Token Program (20%):** Previously used for buyback and burn allocation, this 20% of reserve revenue is now directed to the Venus Prime Token program.

### Allocation for Additional Revenue Streams

Other revenue streams include liquidation penalties, where the protocol takes a 5% fee from the liquidated amount, and potential income generated from future product releases. The revenue distribution for these streams will be as follows:

1. **Risk Fund (48%):** The allocation towards the Risk Fund, including financing, will increase to 48% of these additional revenue streams.
2. **XVS Vault Rewards (26%):** The rewards allocated to XVS vault holders will see an increase to 26% of the total revenue from these sources.
3. **DAO Operations and Funding (26%):** The allocation for DAO operations and funding will also be increased to 26% of the additional revenue.

This dual allocation model accounts for the diverse revenue sources within the Venus Protocol ecosystem, ensuring robust and responsive financial management. As the protocol evolves and introduces new products, these models may further be adjusted to optimally serve the Venus community.
