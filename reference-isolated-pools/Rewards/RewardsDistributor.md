# RewardsDistributor

Contract used to configure, track and distribute rewards to users based on their actions (borrows and supplies) in the protocol.
Users can receive additional rewards through a `RewardsDistributor`. Each `RewardsDistributor` proxy is initialized with a specific reward
token and `Comptroller`, which can then distribute the reward token to users that supply or borrow in the associated pool.
Authorized users can set the reward token borrow and supply speeds for each market in the pool. This sets a fixed amount of reward
token to be released each block for borrowers and suppliers, which is distributed based on a userâ€™s percentage of the borrows or supplies
respectively. The owner can also set up reward distributions to contributor addresses (distinct from suppliers and borrowers) by setting
their contributor reward token speed, which similarly allocates a fixed amount of reward token per block.

The owner has the ability to transfer any amount of reward tokens held by the contract to any other address. Rewards are not distributed
automatically and must be claimed by a user calling `claimRewardToken()`. Users should be aware that it is up to the owner and other centralized
entities to ensure that the `RewardsDistributor` holds enough tokens to distribute the accumulated rewards of users and contributors.
