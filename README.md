# Overview

Launched in 2020, Venus Protocol (a.k.a. “Venus”) pushed the edges of decentralized finance through its composition of two pre-existing solutions and deployment on BNB chain, lowering the barrier to entry for millions of new users around the globe. By combining the stablecoin minting facility introduced by Maker and algorithmic money markets developed by Compound, Venus simplified the user experience and provided core capabilities that enabled decentralized finance to flourish in a single application. As a result, Venus found remarkable success and quickly rose to be one of the most widely used decentralized applications in web3.

1. Risk management
2. Decentralization
3. User experience
