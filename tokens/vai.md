# VAI

### Overview

VAI is the stablecoin of Venus Protocol. To ensure its stability and peg to 1 USD, Venus V4 introduces several mechanisms to maintain its value at $1.

### Stability Fee and Optimised Minting

VAIâ€™s value is maintained via a stability fee. Users pay this fee when repaying minted VAI. It gets added continuously to the user's VAI minted balance every block. The fee encourages users to mint or burn VAI according to its price, helping to maintain the stable value.

### VAI Minting Rate and Minting Cap

Venus V4 modifies how much VAI a user can mint, taking into account their weighted supply. This change protects users from potential liquidation due to minting excessive VAI.

A global cap on total VAI minting is also introduced, controlling how much total VAI can be minted across the platform, providing another layer of stability.
